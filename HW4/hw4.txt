-----------QUESITIONS------------
---------------------------------
1. In general, what is the influence of the number of folds on the running time?
2. Is there a connection between your answer for the first question to the number of instances that used in the classification (the number that you printed)? If yes, what is the connection? If not, explain why not?

---------------------------------
-------------ANSWERS-------------
---------------------------------
1.
Let k be the number of folds.
As we can see in the output, when k grows, there are two changes:
	(a) The total running time grows.
	(b) The average running time for each fold decreases.
Explanation for (a): when k grows we need more iterations(one for each fold) => More running time.
Explanation for (b): when k grows each fold contains less instances in the validation set,
So the average running time for the validation sets decreases.

2.
Yes, there is a connection.
When k grows, each instance is used in the cross-validation-training-set for more folds(eg used in k-1 folds for "EditMode.none").
So when k grows, instances are counted more times.
Counting the same instance many times indicates that the instance appears in many folds, thus
the distance to the instance is calculated many times => running time grows.
To conclude: The "number of instances" in the output is positively correlated with the running time.
